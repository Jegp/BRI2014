\section{Introduction}
In an old Danish sketch about a sailing raft on actor, actor \texttt{A}, tries to explain a theatrical scene to another actor, actor \texttt{B}. The sketch begins by \texttt{A} explaining how a scene with a raft ends in a humorous climax. \texttt{B} stops \texttt{A} in his storytelling to asks what a 'climax' means. Actor \texttt{A} explains (slightly annoyed) that a climax is as an abstract peak of events. \texttt{B} nods and repeats that the raft sketch contains an abstract mountain. \texttt{B} then asks what \textit{abstract} means and \texttt{A} (even more annoyed) explains that \textit{abstract} is something that is not there. The confusion is complete when \texttt{B} surely concludes that the raft scene contains a mountain that is not there. Needless to say, the conversation does not benefit either \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} \citep{Raft:2014}.

This type of '\textit{raft-talk}' is not uncommon when experts in information systems (IS) encounters people outside the lingo. One example is a debate between a danish politician and a danish blogger about the recent surveillance scandals \citep{Bramsen:2014}. The interview has been heavily debated on social medias and led to some aggression because the IS felt misunderstood (ibid.).

In this essay I will attempt to analyse why these difficulties in communication to and from IS related topics occurs.
By using Wernick et al. and Thomas Kuhn's theory on paradigms \citep{Wernick:2004, Holm:2004}, I will examine if, and if is how, the field of software engineering and IS can be understood as incommensurable paradigms.

By applying utilitarianism and Moore's text on 'computer ethics' \citep{Moor:1985}, I will discuss the above ideas and test if the 'old' non-digital society have any common grounds with the 'new' digital.

Lastly I will discuss the two analyses and outline methods for further studies.

\section{Theory}
In this section I will include the theory about paradigms from Thomas Kuhn, and utilitarianism from Bentham and Mill. Before moving on to the analysis I will define software engineering as a field, as seen in the light of Wernick et al. and Moor \citep{Wernick:2004, Moor:1985}.

\subsection{Paradigms} \label{Theory:Paradigms}
When examining how real sciences evolve, Kuhn introduced the idea of a \textit{paradigm} \citep[p. 59]{Holm:2014}. Kuhn defines a paradigm as achievements that is
\begin{quote}
``sufficiently unprecedented to attract an enduring group of adherents away from competing modes of scientific activity ... [and] sufficiently open-ended to leave all sorts of problems for the ... practitioners to resolve'' \citep[p. 10-11]{Kuhn:2012}.
\end{quote}
A paradigm, then, are the new and unprecedented achievements, which opens up for new understandings of a scientific discipline \citep[p. 61]{Holm:2014}.

When a new paradigm



\subsection{Utilitarianism}
In its most fundamental form the question of ownership of land, food and primary resources has existed for a
very very long time. Over the course of history, moral and cultural rules have evolved to address the
many confusion and strives over this matter. Faced with immaterialities such as
ideas and intellectual properties however, 'who owns what' becomes an increasingly hard question to answer. Ideas can be thought of by anyone, but the practical execution of them requires work from the physical domain. A domain where \texttt{you}

If intellect can be owned by everyone, and intellect can reason about ideas, how can ideas be owned? 

Copyright and software ownership can be considered as 

\section{Analysis}
The problem with the example from the raft sketch from the introduction is, of course, that the two actors does not speak the same language, or, in terms of Kuhn, act within the same disciplinary matrix \citep{Holm:2014}.
